* I did not have any technical problems with the installation, but had one problem with the test. I used collection instead of sets, but realised it eventually.

* I had to change .show_sql to true in the .xml file. And then I could use IntelliJ and press on "Persistence" to see the database tables 

* I don't think I had anny pending issues that I didn't manage to solve
