# DAT250: Experiment 1 Report

This report documents the steps taken to complete the first DAT250 assignment.

Since the exercise mostly was a step-by-step guide, I did most of the time only followed the guide and got the results as described in the steps.

During step 1 I had to make a new repository which was very easy to do by following the guide

During step 2 I meet on an issue when was going to name the "source package" as in the example, so I had to run all the steps one more time and then I just picked the default name.
I also stepped in som problems since I did not have used my key to git in a long time, so had to make a new one to push the changes.

During step 3 I had to fix some problems as described, I only did the once as mentioned and got the application to run.

In Step 4 I had to refactor the code, and make a test. The test never failed

In step 5 I also stepped Into som problems since this is complete new for me, and I used chat-gpt to make an easier step-by-step guide. But one of the problems I got did came for that I made the Dockerfile a txt file

Else I guess I manage to solve everything without so many problems, since the tasks was just to follow the different steps
